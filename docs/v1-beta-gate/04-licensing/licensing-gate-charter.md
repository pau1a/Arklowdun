# Licensing Gate Charter Baseline

[‚Üê Back to the licensing & compliance overview](./licensing-compliance-overview.md)

## Objective
Establish a complete charter for the licensing gate by expanding `docs/v1-beta-gate/04-licensing/README.md` with the goal, scope, exit criteria, responsibilities, and review cadence required for the gate to operate as part of the release process.

## Current state
* `docs/v1-beta-gate/04-licensing/README.md` is effectively empty and does not communicate the purpose or expectations of the gate.
* No single document outlines the owners, workflows, or definition of done for licensing compliance.

## Inputs and references
* Product release policy and any existing gate charters for other domains (security, QA, etc.).
* Historical compliance notes (if any) from issue trackers or prior release meetings.
* Organizational standards for documentation tone/structure.

## Detailed specification
1. **Baseline the README structure.**
   * Document the gate goal in plain language (why it exists).
   * Enumerate in-scope vs. out-of-scope activities with concrete examples (e.g., dependency inventory is in scope, legal review of custom contracts is not).
2. **Define exit criteria.**
   * Translate the licensing & compliance exit condition into testable checkpoints (NOTICE automation, font/icon attribution, copyleft audit, documentation updates).
   * Capture evidence requirements (artifacts, reports, checklists) that must be attached to release candidates.
3. **Identify ownership & stakeholders.**
   * Name the accountable owner(s) (team or role) and the supporting roles (legal counsel, release manager, etc.).
   * Describe how escalations are handled when blockers emerge.
4. **Document process flow.**
   * Outline trigger points (e.g., nightly CI, pre-release freeze) for running licensing checks.
   * Specify required tooling integrations and communication channels (Slack, email, dashboards).
5. **Establish review cadence.**
   * Note how often the charter is revisited, and by whom, to ensure it remains accurate as dependencies or regulations change.
6. **Add cross references.**
   * Link out to the other five deep-dive specifications that implement the exit criteria.
   * Include placeholders for future appendices (FAQs, glossary) to maintain discoverability.

## Deliverables
* A fully populated `docs/v1-beta-gate/04-licensing/README.md` containing all sections described above.
* Updated intra-document links from the README to the implementation specifications.

## Acceptance criteria
* Document is written in clear, reviewable prose and follows the documentation style guide.
* Every exit criterion is unambiguously expressed with measurable evidence requirements.
* Stakeholders reviewing the README can identify their responsibilities without external context.

## Dependencies & sequencing
* None blocking authoring, but final validation should happen after the other five workstreams define their artifacts to keep terminology aligned.

## Risks & mitigations
* **Risk:** Missing context from legal/compliance stakeholders.
  * **Mitigation:** Schedule review sessions and incorporate their feedback before finalizing.
* **Risk:** Charter drifts out of sync with automation deliverables.
  * **Mitigation:** Reference versioning strategy and include change-log expectations within the document.
