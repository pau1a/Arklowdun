# V1 Beta Gate — Operational

This folder is the source of truth for v1 closed-beta readiness.
A PR must reference **exact checklist items** here and attach evidence links.

## Areas
1. [Frontend Structure & UX Coherence](./01-frontend-ux/README.md)
2. [Timekeeping Correctness](./02-timekeeping/README.md)
3. [Data Safety & Recovery](./03-data-safety/README.md)
4. [Licensing & Compliance](./04-licensing/README.md)
5. [Platform Security & Distribution](./05-platform-security/README.md)

## Completion Rule
Beta is ready only when every area’s `checklist.md` is 100% checked and `status.yaml` says `complete: true`.
