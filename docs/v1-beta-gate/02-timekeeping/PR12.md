# PR-12 Mandate — RDATE Stance (Documentation Only)

## Objective
Explicitly record the project’s stance on **RDATE support**: out of scope for v1, deferred to a later release.  
Ensure contributors and testers understand that RDATE is not implemented, not tested, and should not be assumed available.

---

## Scope
- Create a new documentation file `/docs/rdate-policy.md` that:
  - Defines what RDATE is (per RFC 5545).
  - States that RDATE support is **excluded** from v1.
  - Explains the rationale: complexity, low immediate need, resource prioritisation.
  - Outlines potential future considerations for adding RDATE (separate PRs, matrix tests, migration impact).
- Update existing docs:
  - Add explicit note in `/docs/recurrence-matrix.md` that RDATE is **not covered** by the test suite.
  - Add footnote in `/docs/v1-beta-gate.md` checklist clarifying exclusion.
- Ensure any references in code comments that mention RDATE point developers to the new policy doc.

---

## Non-Goals
- No code changes to recurrence expansion engine.  
- No tests, fixtures, or IPC handling for RDATE.  
- No migration scripts or DB schema changes.  

---

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **New Doc Created:** `/docs/rdate-policy.md` exists with clear definition, exclusion statement, rationale, and future considerations.  
2. **Cross-References:** Mentions of RDATE in `/docs/recurrence-matrix.md` and `/docs/v1-beta-gate.md` updated to point at the policy doc.  
3. **Code Comments:** Any inline TODOs or comments referencing RDATE updated to refer to `/docs/rdate-policy.md`.  
4. **Clarity:** Contributors and testers reading the docs understand that RDATE is explicitly unsupported in v1.  
5. **No Code Touch:** Confirm no logic or tests are modified beyond comment updates.

---

## Evidence Required in PR
- **Doc Proof:** Show the content of `/docs/rdate-policy.md`.  
- **Cross-Reference Proof:** Snippets from updated docs pointing at the policy.  
- **Comment Proof:** Example of code comment updated to reference the doc.  
- **CI Proof:** Normal build passes with no code or test changes.  

---

## Rollback Plan
- Delete `/docs/rdate-policy.md`.  
- Remove cross-references in other docs.  
- Restore any code comments to previous form.  
- Rollback is trivial and carries no runtime consequences.  

---

## PR Title / Description
- **Title:** `docs(rdate): document exclusion of RDATE support from v1`  
- **Body:** Must include Objective, Scope, Non-Goals, Acceptance Criteria, Evidence, and Rollback.
