# PR A — Phase 6: Integration & Performance Validation

## Summary

- Exercised attachment create, update, and delete guard flows for every supported table, proving they return vault-normalised paths that remain inside the canonical root.
- Added negative-path assertions that confirm guard errors carry hashed relative-path context and stage metadata for traversal and invalid category failures.
- Benchmarked 100 concurrent `Vault::resolve` calls to ensure average latency stays within the 5 ms budget while maintaining hashed-path suffix validation.

## Checklist Alignment

- [x] Integration coverage hits attachment CRUD per category using the shared vault instance.
- [x] Guard rejections validate canonical error codes and hashed telemetry context.
- [x] `Vault::resolve` concurrency benchmark demonstrates ≤ 5 ms average latency under load.

## Follow-ups

- None; Phase 7 will finalise the acceptance checklist using the expanded test suite and recorded benchmark.
