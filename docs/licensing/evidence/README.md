# Copyleft Evidence Storage

This directory stores non-sensitive evidence supporting the current copyleft audit:

- Checksums for upstream source archives.
- Links to publicly accessible tarballs or git commits.
- Redacted remediation notes safe for general distribution.

Do **not** place restricted correspondence or private source snapshots here. Follow the instructions in `docs/licensing.md` and upload sensitive material to the compliance SharePoint (`Copyleft Evidence/2025-09`). Reference the external location from `docs/licensing/copyleft-audit-record.yaml` instead of duplicating it in the repository.
