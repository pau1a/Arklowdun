findings:
  - package: "@axe-core/playwright"
    version: 4.10.2
    ecosystem: npm
    license: MPL-2.0
    classification: weak
    distribution: tooling
    obligations:
      - Keep package scoped to development workflows; confirm it is excluded from production bundles.
      - Retain MPL-2.0 license text in NOTICE archives even though the package does not ship.
    remediation:
      status: complete
      owner: QA Engineering
      due: 2025-09-26
      notes: |
        Verified via dependency analyzer that the package is only referenced in Playwright accessibility tests.
        No runtime bundles include it; no further action required beyond periodic verification.
  - package: axe-core
    version: 4.10.3
    ecosystem: npm
    license: MPL-2.0
    classification: weak
    distribution: tooling

      status: complete
      owner: QA Engineering
      due: 2025-09-26
      notes: |
        Transitive dependency of `@axe-core/playwright`; inherits the same non-distribution posture.
  - package: cssparser
    version: 0.29.6
    ecosystem: cargo
    license: MPL-2.0
    classification: weak
    distribution: release

    remediation:
      status: complete
      owner: Release Engineering
      due: 2025-09-26
      notes: |
        NOTICE bundle already embeds MPL-2.0 text via the consolidated inventory.
        No local patches exist; audit linked upstream source at https://crates.io/crates/cssparser/0.29.6.
  - package: cssparser-macros

      status: complete
      owner: Release Engineering
      due: 2025-09-26

        Shares upstream provenance with `cssparser`; no additional obligations beyond maintaining NOTICE coverage.

    version: 0.2.0
    ecosystem: cargo
    license: MPL-2.0
    classification: weak

      - Re-evaluate if static linking changes obligations (currently file-level only).
    remediation:
      status: complete
      owner: Runtime Team
      due: 2025-09-26
      notes: |
