Round-trip fixture handbook
==========================

This text file replaces the binary handbook sample that previously shipped with the large fixture corpus.  It remains intentionally verbose so that it exercises medium sized attachment handling while staying entirely in UTF-8 text.  The content describes best practices for round-trip testing and is repeated to reach a representative size for CI validation.

Section 1: Goals
----------------
The round-trip workflow demonstrates that export and import tools faithfully preserve application state.  Each run must begin from a deterministic dataset that resembles organic usage while remaining reproducible across environments.

Section 2: Seeding Strategy
---------------------------
Seeders should combine stable pseudo-random data with curated edge cases.  This hybrid approach ensures consistency for verification while still surfacing tricky bugs related to ordering, recurrence rules, and attachments.

Section 3: Attachment Guidance
------------------------------
Attachments exercise filesystem integration.  Provide a mixture of small and medium files, reuse a shared corpus, and preserve unicode filename coverage.  Avoid storing binary blobs in version control; instead rely on text-based fixtures that expand through repetition.

Section 4: Verification
-----------------------
Verification compares table counts, sample hashes, and attachment metadata between pre-export and post-import databases.  Failures must emit structured diagnostics so that developers can rapidly identify mismatches.

Section 5: Runtime Budgets
--------------------------
The CI job balances thoroughness and runtime.  Keep the dataset substantial enough to catch regressions while ensuring the workflow completes within the allowed window.

Round-trip fixture handbook
==========================

This text file replaces the binary handbook sample that previously shipped with the large fixture corpus.  It remains intentionally verbose so that it exercises medium sized attachment handling while staying entirely in UTF-8 text.  The content describes best practices for round-trip testing and is repeated to reach a representative size for CI validation.

Section 1: Goals
----------------
The round-trip workflow demonstrates that export and import tools faithfully preserve application state.  Each run must begin from a deterministic dataset that resembles organic usage while remaining reproducible across environments.

Section 2: Seeding Strategy
---------------------------
Seeders should combine stable pseudo-random data with curated edge cases.  This hybrid approach ensures consistency for verification while still surfacing tricky bugs related to ordering, recurrence rules, and attachments.

Section 3: Attachment Guidance
------------------------------
Attachments exercise filesystem integration.  Provide a mixture of small and medium files, reuse a shared corpus, and preserve unicode filename coverage.  Avoid storing binary blobs in version control; instead rely on text-based fixtures that expand through repetition.

Section 4: Verification
-----------------------
Verification compares table counts, sample hashes, and attachment metadata between pre-export and post-import databases.  Failures must emit structured diagnostics so that developers can rapidly identify mismatches.

Section 5: Runtime Budgets

Round-trip fixture handbook
==========================

This text file replaces the binary handbook sample that previously shipped with the large fixture corpus.  It remains intentionally verbose so that it exercises medium sized attachment handling while staying entirely in UTF-8 text.  The content describes best practices for round-trip testing and is repeated to reach a representative size for CI validation.

Section 1: Goals
----------------
The round-trip workflow demonstrates that export and import tools faithfully preserve application state.  Each run must begin from a deterministic dataset that resembles organic usage while remaining reproducible across environments.

Section 2: Seeding Strategy
---------------------------
Seeders should combine stable pseudo-random data with curated edge cases.  This hybrid approach ensures consistency for verification while still surfacing tricky bugs related to ordering, recurrence rules, and attachments.

Section 3: Attachment Guidance
------------------------------
Attachments exercise filesystem integration.  Provide a mixture of small and medium files, reuse a shared corpus, and preserve unicode filename coverage.  Avoid storing binary blobs in version control; instead rely on text-based fixtures that expand through repetition.

Section 4: Verification

Round-trip fixture handbook
==========================

This text file replaces the binary handbook sample that previously shipped with the large fixture corpus.  It remains intentionally verbose so that it exercises medium sized attachment handling while staying entirely in UTF-8 text.  The content describes best practices for round-trip testing and is repeated to reach a representative size for CI validation.

Section 1: Goals
----------------
The round-trip workflow demonstrates that export and import tools faithfully preserve application state.  Each run must begin from a deterministic dataset that resembles organic usage while remaining reproducible across environments.

Section 2: Seeding Strategy
---------------------------
Seeders should combine stable pseudo-random data with curated edge cases.  This hybrid approach ensures consistency for verification while still surfacing tricky bugs related to ordering, recurrence rules, and attachments.

Seeders should combine stable pseudo-random data with curated edge cases.  This hybrid approach ensures consistency for verification while still surfacing tricky bugs related to ordering, recurrence rules, and attachments.

Section 3: Attachment Guidance
------------------------------
Attachments exercise filesystem integration.  Provide a mixture of small and medium files, reuse a shared corpus, and preserve unicode filename coverage.  Avoid storing binary blobs in version control; instead rely on text-based fixtures that expand through repetition.

Section 4: Verification
-----------------------
Verification compares table counts, sample hashes, and attachment metadata between pre-export and post-import databases.  Failures must emit structured diagnostics so that developers can rapidly identify mismatches.

Section 5: Runtime Budgets

The content describes best practices for round-trip testing and is repeated to reach a representative size for CI validation.

Section 1: Goals
----------------
The round-trip workflow demonstrates that export and import tools faithfully preserve application state.  Each run must begin from a deterministic dataset that resembles organic usage while remaining reproducible across environments.

Section 2: Seeding Strategy
---------------------------
Seeders should combine stable pseudo-random data with curated edge cases.  This hybrid approach ensures consistency for verification while still surfacing tricky bugs related to ordering, recurrence rules, and attachments.

Section 3: Attachment Guidance
------------------------------
Attachments exercise filesystem integration.  Provide a mixture of small and medium files, reuse a shared corpus, and preserve unicode filename coverage.  Avoid storing binary blobs in version control; instead rely on text-based fixtures that expand through repetition.

Section 4: Verification
-----------------------
Verification compares table counts, sample hashes, and attachment metadata between pre-export and post-import databases.  Failures must emit structured diagnostics so that developers can rapidly identify mismatches.

Section 5: Runtime Budgets
--------------------------
The CI job balances thoroughness and runtime.  Keep the dataset substantial enough to catch regressions while ensuring the workflow completes within the allowed window.
